# Practicalli Git Configuration 
#
# for projects maintained by Practicalli
# all commits & tags are signed

# --- Identity

[user]
  # Add identity to all commits
	name = Practicalli Engineering
	email = "engineering@practical.li"

  # SSH Key for signing
	signingkey = ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

[github]
  # Identity for using GitHub API

# --- Security

[gpg]
  # Use SSH key to sign commits and tags

# --- Git Behaviour

[init]
	# scripts and hooks to add when creating a new local Git repository
	# templateDir = ~/.config/git/repo-template/

	# default branch name when creating a new local repository
	defaultBranch = main

[core]
	# Set which editor to use for editing commit messages (when not included with -m)
	# VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables also set the choice of editor
	# vi used if not set.  Typical examples are nvim or emacsclient
	editor = astronvim

	# file and directory patterns to ignore across all projects
	excludesfile = ignore

	# Tool to page through long output (e.g. git log). `less` is default
	# pager = less

	# Ensure Linux & MacOSX line endings in checked out text files
	autocrlf = input

[commit]
	# Default commit message - useful if team has a commit message policy
	template = ~/.config/git/commit-message-practicalli
  # Automatically sign every commit
	gpgsign = true

[tag]
  # Automatically sign every tag

[merge]
