# Regolith Linux configuration

Minor configuration for tweaking the existing themes (looks) that [Regolith Linux 1.6](https://regolith-linux.org/) provides

[Practicalli created a light theme was created for Regolith version 1.4](https://github.com/practicalli/regolith-solarized-light), which requires a little work for use with Regolith 1.6.  As Regolith 1.6 provides a solarized-light theme,  the practicalli theme is on hold until [Regolith 2.0](https://regolith-linux.org/) is out of beta.


## Configuration files

* $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/regolith/Xresources - customisation applied on top of Regolith looks (themes)
